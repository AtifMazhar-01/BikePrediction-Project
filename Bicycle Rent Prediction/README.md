 Bike Prediction Project
 
 Overview

This project predicts daily bike rental counts using machine learning techniques.
The dataset (day.csv) contains information about bike rentals on different days, along with features such as weather, season, temperature, and more.

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a predictive model that estimates bike demand.

 Installation & Setup

1.Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/AtifMazhar-01/BikePrediction-Project.git
cd BikePrediction-Project

2.Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows

3.Install required libraries

pip install -r requirements.txt

4.Open the notebook

jupyter notebook BikePrediction.ipynb




Dataset

The dataset (day.csv) includes:

Date: Record date

Season: Season of the year

Weather: Weather situation

Temperature: Normalized temperature in Celsius

Humidity: Relative humidity

Windspeed: Wind speed

Casual / Registered / Count: Bike rental counts


Model & Approach

Data preprocessing: Cleaning & feature engineering

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of trends

Modeling: Regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Evaluation: Metrics such as RMSE and R²


Results

Identified key factors influencing bike rentals.

Built a model that provides a good prediction accuracy.



Future Improvements

Try deep learning models.

Add more external factors (holidays, special events).

Deploy model as a web app (Streamlit/Flask).
